Hey! 

This is my first ever Game project I made.
Basically, this is a clone of "Flappy Bird", but since my usual Username everywhere online is "Flame", I decided to make it a Flame, that tries jumping through (two) water geysers.

In the current version there is no feature to die yet when you fall down, but that will be added shortly. 
In a few hours from now (14:30UST) I will add those two features and commit again - this part is gonna be removed then. 

Dying itself is possible when hitting a pipe, but when you fall down for now, it's not gonna kill you so you either have to spam jump until you reach one of the geysers and die through that, or just Alt F4 quit the game and restart. 


Btw, the sprites are also made by no other than me :D
